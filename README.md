Introduction To Java
-----
Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language. The language is designed to have as few dependencies implementations as possible. The intention of using this language is to give relief to the developers from writing codes for every platform. The term WORA, write once and run everywhere is often associated with this language. It means whenever we compile a Java code, we get the byte code (.class file), and that can be executed (without compiling it again) on different platforms provided they support Java. In the year 1995, Java language was developed. It is mainly used to develop web, desktop, and mobile devices. The Java language is known for its robustness, security, and simplicity features. That is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

History
----
The Java language has a very interesting history. Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and Jame Gosling, known as the Green team, started the development of Java in the year 1991. These people were the engineers at Sun Microsystems. In 1996, the first public implementation was released as Java 1.0. The compiler of Java 1.0 was rewritten by Arthur Van Hoff to comply strictly with its specification. With the introduction of Java 2, the new versions have multiple different configurations that have been built for the various platforms. It is worth noting that James Gosling is also known as the father of Java.

The ISO standard body was approached by Sun Microsystems in the year 1997 to formalize Java, but the process was withdrawn soon. At one point in time, Sun Microsystems provided most of its implementation of Java available without any cost, despite having the status of proprietary software.
